Hi, I'm Hamish Williams. I am an alumnus of The University of Waikato's Bachelor of Computer Graphic Design – a comprehensive degree that combines both technical and creative skills. I worked as a graphic designer in New Zealand for a year before moving to Sydney, where I now work as a digital designer at Smart Sparrow. Drop me a message and we can grab sushi sometime.
